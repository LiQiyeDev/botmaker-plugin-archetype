# botmaker-plugin-archetype

`mvn archetype:generate` for a **BotMaker Studio plugin**.

```bash
mvn archetype:generate \
  -DarchetypeGroupId=com.github.LiQiyeDev \
  -DarchetypeArtifactId=botmaker-plugin-archetype \
  -DarchetypeVersion=v0.1.0 \
  -DarchetypeRepository=https://jitpack.io
```

`-DarchetypeRepository` is required: BotMaker publishes through JitPack, and Maven does not read a project's
`<repositories>` when resolving an archetype — there is no project yet.

It asks four questions beyond the usual coordinates, each with a working default:

| property | default | what it is |
|---|---|---|
| `pluginId` | the groupId | what `StudioPlugin.id()` returns, and what the registry refuses twice. **Not** the Maven coordinate — a plugin may be re-published under a new one and must keep its id. |
| `pluginName` | the artifactId | what Studio shows in *Manage Plugins*. |
| `studioApiVersion` | `main-SNAPSHOT` | the contract version written into the generated pom. |
| `toolkitVersion` | `main-SNAPSHOT` | the toolkit version written into the generated pom. |

## What comes out

A project that **builds and passes its tests with no edits**:

- `pom.xml` with the three scopes that are easy to get wrong — `botmaker-studio-api` `provided`,
  `botmaker-plugin-toolkit` `compile`, `javafx-controls` `provided`.
- `META-INF/services/com.botmaker.plugin.api.StudioPlugin`, the only reason Studio ever finds the plugin.
- `ExampleApi` — a facade with one offered method and one `@Hidden` one.
- `ExamplePlugin` — a palette, one registered `ValueType` with a codec, and one slot editor chosen by the
  **call** rather than by the type.
- `ExamplePluginTest` — seven tests including the ones a plugin author normally never writes: the contexts
  the editor must *decline*.

## Why the versions default to `main-SNAPSHOT`

It is a real JitPack coordinate — the tip of that repository's main branch — and it never goes stale. The
alternative, a released tag baked in here by `release.sh`, would owe an edit on every contract release and
would silently age between them. `main-SNAPSHOT` is wrong in the other direction, and the generated README
says so where an author can act on it.

## Building

```bash
mvn install     # com.github.LiQiyeDev:botmaker-plugin-archetype:0.0.0-SNAPSHOT
```

To generate against the local reactor rather than JitPack — the fastest way to check a change here:

```bash
mvn install                                # at the umbrella root, so the contract and toolkit are in ~/.m2
cd /tmp && mvn archetype:generate -B \
  -DarchetypeGroupId=com.github.LiQiyeDev \
  -DarchetypeArtifactId=botmaker-plugin-archetype -DarchetypeVersion=0.0.0-SNAPSHOT \
  -DgroupId=com.example -DartifactId=my-plugin \
  -DstudioApiVersion=0.0.0-SNAPSHOT -DtoolkitVersion=0.0.0-SNAPSHOT
cd my-plugin && mvn verify
```

Releases are cut from the umbrella with `../release.sh --plugin-archetype <version>`.
