/**
 * The API this plugin offers a bot, and the class its palette entries are read off.
 *
 * <p><b>Curation is opt-out.</b> Every {@code public} method declared here is offered in Studio's block
 * palette; {@link Hidden} takes one back out. Nothing anywhere lists member names as strings, so renaming
 * {@link #greet} renames the palette entry and cannot leave a catalog pointing at a member that no longer
 * exists.
 *
 * <p>The unit of a palette entry is the member <em>name</em>, not the overload: two {@code greet} methods
 * make one menu entry with a submenu, not two entries.
 *
 * <p>A bot only ever writes down the names in this class, so treat it as the version boundary — you may add
 * to it freely, and anything you remove breaks a bot that already spelled it.
